# MODO_KIT_PATH_LOADER
This kit is designed to let you set your own Path for loading Kits in Modo.
This way you'll not been bound to only use the typical "Kits" path system.
(Luxology/Kits folder or ModoContent/Kits folder)

# INSTALLATION
To define your own kits path, you have to put this kit "KIT_PATH_LOADER" into your "%APPDATA%/Luxology/Kits" folder (Win) or "/Library/Application Support/Luxology/Content/Kits/" (Mac).

Then edit the PATH_LOADER.cfg in KIT_PATH_LOADER/Config.

Change " C:/PATH_OF_KITS_FOLDER_WHERE_YOUR_OWN_KITS_ARE_LOACTED " to your own Localpath or even an address over internet.

Best regards,
Franck Elisabeth
